                                <p class="card-text">My team and I were awarded 1st place in Walmart's Code@thon within the "Customer First" Academy. We developed "Hey Sparky," a voice assistant similar to Amazon's Alexa, which enabled customers to interact with their Walmart shopping cart through voice commands. This project provided an excellent opportunity to showcase my expertise in voice technology and AI. Working alongside a dedicated team, I was able to contribute to an innovative solution that aligned with Walmart's focus on putting customers first. This experience not only expanded my skills in voice recognition and AI but also deepened my passion for working on cutting-edge projects. I am proud of our achievements and excited for future opportunities to contribute to groundbreaking initiatives.</p>

While others may gravitate toward video games, I tend to focus on more technical hobbies, such as 3D printing, Arduino programming, and ham radio. These activities allow me to dive into hands-on projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills, constantly expanding my knowledge and technical abilities.
