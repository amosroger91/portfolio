                            Additionally, I gained valuable exposure to scripting, web development, and software development. I utilized PowerShell scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as streamlining the ordering process for daily parts, and these automations were adopted team-wide. I also gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web development, and .NET Windows Forms for desktop applications. These contributions not only improved team efficiency but also expanded my technical skill set in a collaborative environment.
